# Blockchain Engineer Written Challenge

Please choose _Section 1_ or _Section 2_ and answer all questions in that section. You can directly write your answers in your branch following the questions.

## Section 1

Assuming we are implementing a 1000X1000 pixel board on-chain. Users can trade pixels, and pixel owners can update the color of the pixel. Client software can then render our the state of the pixel board.

- Question 1: How would you design the smart contract to make the gas fee as low as possible?
- Question 2: How would you choose a public chain that is affordable and scalable?
- Question 3: How would you connect client software to the blockchain, so that it can render millions of pixels in a short amount of time? For example, what node provider would you choose and why, and are there any middleware or indexing infracture you would use or implement?

## Section 2

Assuming we are designing the protocol for a social media. User can follow each other, publish content, and reply to content with data stored on-chain.

- Question 1: How would you design the smart contract to make the gas fee as low as possible?
- Question 2: How would you choose a public chain that is affordable and scalable?
- Question 3: How would you connect client software to the blockchain?
- Question 4: How would you design the system so that it is backward compatible when you upgrade it in the future?
